### DataScience Portfolio Projects
Data Science projects by Jelal. This is my repo for portfolio projects that I did during my [Data Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science).

### Projects 

1) U.S. Medical Insurance Cost project is about investigating the U.S medical insurance dataset. In this project I found out that the people's smoking habit most impactful to their insurance cost. Hence there is correlation between 'smoke' and 'charges' columns. This project is very useful for practicing different analytical skills and also practice the Pandas library. 

2) Life Expectancy and GDP. This project is about understanding - is the growth of life expectancy correlated with their GDPs. In dataset we have5 co untries given their GDP and life expectancy values over 15 years(2000-2015). 5 countries given in dataset: Germany, USA, China, Mexicoa and Zimbabwe. As a result of this project I found out that there is direct correlation between country's GDP and life expectancy - more it has GDP, higher it has life expectancy. Please feel free to explore that python notebook for more insights: [life_expectancy_gdp.py](https://github.com/jenapss/DataScience/blob/main/life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb)
